KISS stands for Keep It Simple Stupid. It is a design principle for keeping things simple rather than complex.

You are the boss of Joe.

Joe is submitting words to you to publish to a blog. He likes to complicate things.

Define a function that determines if Joe's work is simple or complex.

Input will be non emtpy strings with no punctuation.

It is simple if: the length of each word does not exceed the amount of words in the string (See example test cases)

Otherwise it is complex.

If complex:

return "Keep It Simple Stupid"

or if it was kept simple:

return "Good work Joe!"

Note: Random test are random and nonsensical. Here is a silly example of a random test:

"jump always mostly is touchy dancing choice is pineapples mostly"
